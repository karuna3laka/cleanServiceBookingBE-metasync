## 📌 Initial Planning

The project was designed to simulate a full-stack cleaning service booking system using:

* **Frontend:** React + Vite + Firebase Auth + Firestore
* **Backend:** Flask + Firebase Admin SDK
* **Deployment:** Firebase Hosting (Frontend)

**Core Features:**

* Firebase authentication (Sign up / Sign in)
* Service booking form (with user info and time/date)
* Firestore storage of bookings
* Admin dashboard to view/edit bookings (only for authorized admin)

---

## 🔐 Test Admin Credentials

To access **admin features**, please log in using:

* **Email:** `admin@example.com`
* **Password:** `admin@example.com`

**Steps:**

1. Login with the above credentials.
2. Click the **"Are you admin?"** button on the **top-center** of the home page.
3. You will be redirected to the **Admin Dashboard** (if verified as admin in Firestore).

## 🧪 User Instructions

### ✅ Regular Client Usage

* Any user can **register** and **book services** via the main interface.
* Auth & Firestore handle secure data and bookings.

## 🚀 How to Run the Application Locally

### 🔧 Backend (Flask + Firebase Admin SDK)

1. Navigate to the backend folder:

   ```bash
   cd metasyncBE-1
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   **Windows:**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

   **Mac/Linux:**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Add your Firebase Admin credentials to a `.env` or config file (not pushed to GitHub for security).

5. Run the Flask API:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

   > Flask runs by default on `http://localhost:5000`

### 💻 Frontend (React + Vite + Firebase)

1. Navigate to the frontend folder:

   ```bash
   cd metasync-cleanService
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:

   ```bash
